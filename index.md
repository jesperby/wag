# Web Application Guidelines

Version 3.0 for the City of Malmö's intranet, "Komin".
{:.preamble}

## Purpose
The City of Malmö's Web Application Guidelines (WAG) and the global assets are used by web based applications within the organization to give the end user a consistent expirience of the intranet independently of the different technical systems behind the services.

Please contact kominteamet@malmo.se for questions about the WAG.

## Audience
Depending on your role, different sections of the WAGs will be of more or less relevance to you. Familiarize yourself with the guidelines if you:

* Are planning procurement of a system, it can be an existing product or a custom built solution.
* Are developing a new web based application.
* Are a vendor working with the introduction of a new system.
* Are adapting or updating an existing web based application.


## Levels of Compliance

### Custom Built Systems
Custom built systems for the City of Malmö must use all parts of the guidelines. The same is true for central parts of the intranet that employees use for important daily tasks.

Other systems deployed within the organization should use the WAG

### Lowest Level of Compliance
If a system is hopeless, and nothing can be changed in the presentaion layer because it is closely tied to the business logic or worse, you must at least have the masthead injected so that the user can reach other resources on the intranet.


## Browser Support
A [list of devices and browsers](http://malmo.se/Web-Application-Guidelines/Browser-Support.html) that web based intranet services must support is available in the previous version of the WAG.


## Accessibility
[Accessabillity guidelines](http://malmo.se/Web-Application-Guidelines/Accessibility.html) are avaible in the previous version of the WAG.

## Source Code: License and Management
Source code developed for the City of Malmö---it could be a full system, an extension to a system or a component---will be open source licensed under [AGPL 3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt) unless otherwise agreed in writing.

Before you start development, contact kominteamet@malmo.se and request access to a repository in the City of Malmö's Github organization account. Include Github usernames of the project memembers in the request. The Github repository must be used during development and maintanance of the code.

## External Services
If your system has an external audiance, i.e. it is not part of the intranet, you must use [WAG verion 2.0](http://malmo.se/WAG/).
