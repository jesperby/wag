# Getting Started

The term "global assets" refers to the common JavaScript, stylesheet, some web fonts and a few images that are share by all intranet applications. The global asset files are served from an public available asset server, assets.malmo.se. Each application will likely have its own additional assets with application specific styling and functionallity.

## Include the Global Assets In Your Markup
To enable the global assets, you need to include a stylesheet and a JavaScript file in your application as well as a few files for older browser and a favicon reference. Be sure to use a html5 doctype to get it all working.

Your `head` block should look like this:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset='utf-8'/>
    <meta content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0' name='viewport'/>
    <meta content='IE=edge' http-equiv='X-UA-Compatible'/>
    <title>Your Title</title>
    <!--[if lte IE 8]><script src='//assets.malmo.se/internal/3.0/html5shiv-printshiv.js' type='text/javascript'></script><![endif]-->
    <link href='//assets.malmo.se/internal/3.0/malmo.css' media='all' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'/>
    <!--[if lte IE 7]><link href='//assets.malmo.se/internal/3.0/legacy/ie7.css' media='all' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'/><![endif]-->
    <link rel='stylesheet' href='/your_own_stylesheet.css'>
    <link rel='icon' type='image/x-icon' href='//assets.malmo.se/internal/3.0/favicon.ico'/>
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see in the example, your own stylesheet should be added after the global stylesheet. Your own stylesheet contains everything your application need that is not contained in the global assets. Application specific files are not deployed to the asset server, those are served directly from your applications web server.

The `viewport` meta tag must be included to get a responsive application. You *must not* set `maximum-scale` value in the `viewport` meta tag. It is not our business to decide if the user want's to zoom in or not on a narrow device.

JavaScript files should be included just before the end `body` tag.

{% highlight html %}
    ...
    <script src='//assets.malmo.se/internal/3.0/malmo.js'></script>
    <script src='/your_own_javascripts.js'></script>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

Your own JavaScript is placed after the global one.

## Optimize Your Own Assets
Your own stylesheets and JavaScript code must be contcatenated into two files and then minified. If your application has files for older versions of Internet Explorer, include them in contitional comments.

Your own styleheets and JavaScripts must be served with gzip/deflate compression from the web server with http cache headers optimized.

If you're using AMD loading of the assets in your application, all individual files must be minified and you need to optimize the balance beween the number of request and the size of the files.

## [TODO]
* Simple rules:
  * No new windows
  * Units em

* Assets components
  * Masthead
    * body class to get active nav item malmo-masthead-dashboard
  * Service-title?
  * Calendar
  * Tabs?
  * Sub menu?
  * Pagination/load more/endless loading
  * Containing components, jQuery, shiv and widgets


## Your Applications Domain
All web applications must have a subdomain under *.malmo.se. This is essential for the masthead to work.

## Google Analytics
Google Analytics tracking is included in the global assets. Statistics are collected to the City of Malm√∂'s account. This is important so we can analyse traffic and user behaviour across all our services. You *must not* initiate any other Google Analytics account in your application.

If you need to do custom event tracking in your application, please contact kominteamet@malmo.se first so we don't get events with colliding names.

To prevent data from your development and test environments to be collected in the production account, add a `development` or `test` class to the `body` tag. The data will then be collected to our test account.

{% highlight html %}
<body class='development'>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<body class='test'>
{% endhighlight %}

## Global Assets Internals
The source code for the [global assets are available on Github](https://github.com/malmostad/intranet-assets). The deployed version on the asset server is in the 3.0-stable branch and is also the most recent production tag. Pre-releases are deployed to http://assets.malmo.se/internal/3.0-staging/.
